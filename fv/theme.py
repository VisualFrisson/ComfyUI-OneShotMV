"""Theme / vibe: one free-text line that sets the world of the whole video.

`expand(theme)` asks a local language model for a small "world bible" of the video: who the
characters are, what they wear, where they are, the light, what they do in wide shots and a
colour grade, as lists. Casting (casting.apply_theme) then combines those lists per performer
the way a pack does, so a 60-shot run never repeats a look and every shot stays in the world.

The model is Gemma 3 12B, the LTX-2.3 text encoder every Frisson Vision install already has
(run through ComfyUI's own Generate Text), so a theme costs about a minute and no download.
Without it the theme falls back to templates built around the theme sentence.
Results are cached per theme + seed in output/frissonvision/themes/."""

PROMPT = """You design the look of a music video. Theme: "{theme}"
Invent the world of this video. If the theme names jobs, roles, eras or kinds of people, every character is one of them and recognisable at a glance: their outfit, props and place say what they are. Go for specific, era-perfect detail, as if the stylist, the hair and make-up team and the set designer cared about every piece, in the tone the theme asks for: playful and over the top when it is fun, natural and grounded when it says straight, cinematic or serious. Everything must be physically real, things that existed and could be photographed. Never use brand or product names, never real or famous people, nobody holds a microphone, phone or instrument, and nothing carries writing: no signs, posters, banners, menus, screens or scoreboards. Answer with one JSON object only, no other text, with these keys:
"characters": a list of {characters} different characters, each an object with three keys. "who": the role or type first when the theme has them, then age, gender, skin tone, hairdo and one distinctive detail; at most 24 words; all adults, 18 or older; no names. "wear": the outfit that makes this character's role or style obvious, specific in fabric, colour and cut, cut for this character's gender, plain with no text, badges with words or logos; at most 20 words. "place": where this character belongs, starting with "in" or "on"; at most 14 words. Vary everything across the list: roles, ages within what the theme describes, genders, skin tones, builds, hairdos and accessories; not everyone wears glasses, hats or the same jewellery, and no two outfits are alike.
"places": a list of {places} more specific places in this world, each starting with "in" or "on". At most 16 words each.
"light": a list of {light} lighting setups with their colours, specific to this world (its flash, sun, lamps, tube lights or backdrops). At most 16 words each.
"actions": a list of {actions} things one person does in such a place while singing, seen in a wide shot (walking, sitting, leaning, working, dancing and so on). They are alone and their hands are free. At most 9 words each.
"poses": a list of {poses} different poses or expressions for a portrait in this world, in the theme's tone. At most 12 words each.
"grade": the colour grade that fits the theme best, one of: {grades}."""
